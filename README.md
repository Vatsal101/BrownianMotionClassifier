# BrownianMotionClassifier
This is a image classfication Machine learning model made with tensorflow

The machine learning model takes in data of graphs of brownian motion and normal graphs (ex. y=x)
The model trains on this data using CNN (Convulutional Neural Networks) which are very good at image classification
The model can classify images of Brownian motion and non-Brownian motion, however it needs to be trained with more real graphs of stock data as it ineffective at detecting those.
